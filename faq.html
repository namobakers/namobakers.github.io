                <!-- faq answer -->
                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>Well, you might have read once or twice that we are a scratch bakery, and that fact alone sets apart from most other bakeries. This improves the taste and quality of the products we make. Our desserts are not made in factories like those you might purchase from some grocery store bakeries. We never freeze our cakes, though that too is a common practice. Also, we are known for a 100+ year old dense, moist pound cake recipe. Pound cakes are expensive to make, but the unmatched taste is worth every penny. We do have a lighter batter available; however, please specify that you would like a cake or made with our lighter batter when you place your order.</p>

We are accessible during business hours, and you do not need to make an appointment in order to enjoy our products. You are welcome to visit our café anytime during our business hours.</p>

                    <p>We rarely hear complaints about our products, which is why we've stuck around for 40 years.

<h6 class="faq-page">  I've noticed many of your designs contain 3-D elements such as bows and other items sitting on top of the cakes. What are those? </h6>
                <!-- faq answer -->
                <div class="faq-body">
                    <p>Those items are made from sugar-based products. We sculpt them all by hand, which is a very time-consuming process. We rarely use store bought, non-edible decorations on our desserts. These items generally require at least one-two weeks advance notice to create.</p>
